\chapter{Rules}
This chapter describes some development rules.

\section{Basic C++}
The identifier should be named in these ways:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
ClassSomething & First character and every word in uppercase for a \emph{class}\\
identifierSomething & camelCase for all local variables and \emph{members} (notice: no m\_ prefix for texmaker compatibility)\\
headersomething.h & All header in lowercase \\
headersomething.cpp & sources, too \\
HEADERSOMETHING\_H & include guards in uppercase \\
SOME\_CONSTVALUE & const/enum values in uppercase ?????? (with prefix??? without???)
\end{tabular}

Order the include directives from high level to low level, e.g.:\\
\begin{verbatim}
#include "texmaker.h"

#include <qt>
\end{verbatim}
instead of the other way around

Insert only things in texmaker.cpp or smallUsefulFunction.h if it is really necessary,
better create a new .cpp/.h if you can't find one to put it in

\section {Compatibility}
Don't use QT 4.4 or 4.5, only functions of Qt4.3.\\
If they are really necessary you could wrap them in \#if, like: \\
\verb+#if QT_VERSION >= 0x040500+ für Qt 4.5.0\\
\verb+#if QT_VERSION >= 0x040400+ für Qt 4.4.0\\

But this prevents linking with older qts, so it is better  to call hasAtLeastQt(4,5) of smallAndUseful, to check and then call the methods dynamically.\\
Use QMetaObject::invokeMethod for Slots/Signals and QObject::setProperty for properties

Some can be easily replaced, these include:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
example & use instead & remark\\
\hline \\
QFormLayout & QGridLayout\\
Q(String)List.append(Q(String)List)  &  $<<$ & This doesn't apply to .append(T) \\
Q(String)List.length  &  QList.count() \\
Q(String)List.removeOne   &  \verb!if (i=QList.indexOf()>0) QList.removeAt(i)! \\
QRegExp.cap const  & QRegExp.cap & cap has first been made const in 4.5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Those don't exists in old qt, but should be used for the newer version, so they must be included in \#if.
(min version is the minimum version where it can be used)
\begin{tabular}{llll}
example & min version & possible replacement\\
QPalette::ToolTipBase & 4.4 & QPalette::AlternateBase\\
QPalette::ToolTipText & 4.4 & QPalette::Text
\end{tabular}

\chapter{TODO}

\subsection{necessary before 1.9.2 }

\subsubsection{others}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Make a list of new files which have to be included in the installer} 
	%\item \textbf{Update about dialog}  (version, using kile source)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{nice to have before 1.9.2 }
\subsubsection{Bugs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item replace all can count the found places wrong (shows a message: "3 of 2 occurences replaced")
	\item log view isn't scrolled to log start if a new log is loaded
\item \verb+\irgendwas+ wird in der unittest ausgabe rückwärts las \verb+sawdnegri\+ geschrieben
	\item codesnippt mit placeholder einfügen und rückgängig machen plaziert cursor an falscher column position => schreiben zerstört rückgängig
	\item check support for Chinese (bug 2854917)
	\item sprung zur warnung statt error (include with master only?), don't jump away from log file
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{others}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ask for search from scope begin if replace all is finished (and didn't start from scope begin)
	\item Tests: \begin{itemize}
		\item check for completion/spellchecker crashes
		\item codesnippet (especially placeholder), qdocumentcursor, qeditor, ...
	\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{later}

\subsubsection{Bugs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item understand the meaning of: ausschneiden stört cut????
	\item Wrong indentation of \begin{verbatim}
		@MastersThesis{Marold,
		author = {Alexander Marold},
		title = {Rekonstruktion 
		der globalen 
		Ereignisreihenfolge aus lokalen Logdateien},
		school = {Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf},
		year = {2008},
		type = {Bachelorarbeit},
		}
	\end{verbatim} in bib files
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{others}
\begin{itemize}
	\item QCodeEdit: \begin{itemize}
		\item Deleting placeholders by pressing repeadetly backspace after one
		\item don't comment the line the cursor is on when several lines are selected and the no text in this line is selected
		\item %Not annoying auto indentation (three modes: none, local (taking indentation from previous line), global (=like now); 
		inserting several \verb+ \end{unknown}+ should not destroy indentation
		\item folded blocks should not prevent removing/un-/indenting/un-/commenting
		\item bracket auto closing
		\item don't be confused by mismatching brackets (e.g. \verb+$[4,5[$+ for interval)
%>>
%qnfadefinition.cpp, line 1102, replace
%
%if ( ::match(par, parens.top()) )
%
%with
%
%if ( parens.count() > 1 || ::match(par, parens.top()) )
%
%And similarly change line 1233
%<<<<
		\item show tooltips when scrolling (line, section, chapter)
		\item search panel: highlighted match update works in O(foundMatches), but it could theoretically be done in O(log foundMatches);
		and finding the matches the first time needs O(total lines), but O(visible lines) is feasible)
		\item changing default action of mouse drag/drop from copying to moving
		\item RTL support like in texmaker 1.9.0/1 (but there it was removed in 1.9.2) (import fy to unicode)
		\item BUG? (probably fixed already): 
		search something below the current visible area, scroll up, search again, press arrow down, the search result is drawn selected although it isn't
	\end{itemize}
	\item better structure view: \begin{itemize}
		\item BUG: \verb+\chapter{title}\label{label overrides title}+
		\item parser in own file, not in texmaker.cpp
		\item select section title when double clicked of one?
		\item should not close everything after update, should it scroll to selected entry? (like it does in r460)
		\item should show all loaded/included files
		\item parsing not loaded files
		\item should cache old parsing, don't reparse unmodified files
		\item could use .aux files
		\item should not execute several regex after each other on the same line (custom parser? mixed regex?)	
	\end{itemize}
	\item Document Managment \begin{itemize}
		\item class storing tree structure of included files
		\item yields better structure view
		\item Latex Parser class
	\end{itemize}
	\item Synonym dictionary: \begin{itemize}
		\item ignore space on words looked up
		\item remember window size
		\item allow selecting of words with arrow keys
		\item faster contains checks using Tries
		\item support for 
		\item adding own words like in the spell checking 
		\item online lookup (e.g german: wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Labels/References: \begin{itemize}
		\item understand \verb+\nameref, \vref+
		\item 	show all refs using a label and allow easy jumping to them (e.g selection window?)
		\item check references to other files
		\item using a SoundEx suggestion list for wrong references/labels like in the spell checker
		\item a reference/label check dialog like the old spell checking dialog
	\end{itemize}
	\item Citations: \begin{itemize}
		\item automatically call bibtex if .bib files are changed
		\item bib tex parser in own class
		\item with unit tests
		\item show SoundEx suggestion for wrong citatinos
		\item check environment paths (e.g. \verb+BIBINPUTS = C:\My Documents\CDMA\Papers\Bib;C:\My Documents\GPS\Papers\Bib+)
		\item references to all included files
	\end{itemize}
	\item Better new document wizard (look at kile, support for geometry package)
	\item Completion List \begin{itemize}
		\item treat \verb+\+abc\{\%<xyz\%>\} and \verb+\+abc\{\%<def\%>\} as identical and ignore one of thems
		\item Understand \verb+\usepackage}, newcounter, tex: \newcount  \def, \edef, \xdef, \gdef+
		\item text completion should show parameters of commands (e.g. reference names) even if they aren't currently used
		\item merging text completion and spell checker cache?
	\end{itemize}
	\item GUI: \begin{itemize}
		\item using new tm 1.9.2 icons
		\item new tm 1.9 output view (icons left instead of tabs + next/previous error buttons)
		\item using icons for math font styles (like in text font style)
		\item Customizable tool bars
		\item Customizable symbol lists
		\item combo boxes (dropdown tool buttons) instead of several icons for each command (like 1.9 or kile)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Preview: \begin{itemize}
		\item allow real zoom (regenerating png)
	\end{itemize}
	\item  Checker: \begin{itemize}
		\item Silbentrennung: \verb+http://homepage.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/Georg.Verweyen/silbentrennung.html+
		\item Respect \verb+\verb+ or even multiline \verb+\begin{verbatim}+
		\item Grammar Checker
		\item LaTeX Checker	(calling lacheck?)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Building \begin{itemize}
		\item Don't require to save everything (temporary location?)
		\item Asymptote support
		\item Having a placeholder for current document and cursor position (like ?ame) perhaps ?ane) or ?ace) (needed for forward invert search)
		\item Is the output of (pdf)latex shown? should it?
		\item Improved recognizing of tool paths, checking of correct tool settings,  custom build actions: planned (although former is finished for miktex+ghostscript)
		\item better browser detection in WebPublish dialog 
		\item running arbitrary commands as CMD\_UNKNOWN
		\item better user command (allow to run the other programs as intern://latex, intern://view/dvi, intern://showlog ?)
		\item if the parameters of the user and the program differ, which should be used? (that problem is the reason, ghostscript have to be the plain program name)
		\item . command tooltips (right section?)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Configuration \begin{itemize}
		\item open combobox for shortcut changing if double clicked on standard shortcut
		\item move from texmaker.cpp to configmanager.cpp (texmaker.cpp should have less than 1000 lines)
		\item use some macro tricks, so that not everything has to be written five times (header declaration, loading, storing, config dialog in, config dialog out)
		\item update all overlays (environment, spell checking, refs..) when they are en/disabled in the config dialog (? will be slow? disabling => just remove overlays instead reparsing)
	\end{itemize} 
	\item Recognizing hand written symbols (online lookup in detextify)
	\item New Tabular Dialog (of kile)
	\item Having functions to select environments/blocks/sections, changing \verb+$$+ to \verb+\[\]+, or to \verb+\begin{something}+ (waiting for qce2.3 syntax engine)
	\item Unit Tests (gui, qeditor, qdocument,..)
\end{itemize}
