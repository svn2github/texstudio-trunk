<h1><a name="SECTIONNEW">0. What's new</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTIONNEW19">0.1 Version 1.8.1 -> Version 1.9</a></h2>

<P>TeXstudio has been diligently extended for the last months. The
subsequent list gives a probably incomplete overview of new and
changed functionality:</P>
<ul>
	<LI><P>First steps for dynamic syntax highlighting have been
	implemented. For example references in in commands like \label or
	\ref are checked and are marked especially if the reference does not
	exist (in case of referencing) or if it has been defined multiple
	times.</P>
	<LI><P>The word completion system has been extended. It now uses
	&ldquo;kile&rdquo;-word lists which extend the number of known
	commands considerably. The key Tab can be used to complete common word bases in the present suggestion list like it is done in bash shells.
	Furthermore it can also complete normal text
	by proposing earlier used text parts. The two modes are
	distinguished by a backslash as starting letter. And finally &ldquo;User
	Tags&rdquo; (user defined text blocks) can be inserted  by using
	user defined abbreviations which replaced in the completion process.
	The old behavior of using key sequences for inserting user tags
	certainly is still available. And lastly user defined latex commands
	are automatically scanned and can be used for command completion.</P>
	<LI><P>Apart from using wizards, new documents can be created by
	using templates. User can add own templates which can be edited or
	removed later on if necessary.</P>
	<LI><P>The symbol panel was extended. It was also extended by &ldquo;kile&rdquo;
	symbol list. It also can insert &ldquo;tags&rdquo; from textual
	lists. And finally the column count automatically adapts to the
	available horizontal space. Not to mention that unwanted symbol
	lists can be hidden.</P>
	<LI><P>The symbol list selector was moved to the left edge to give
	more room for the symbols, like it was done in texmaker.</P>
	<LI><P>Hover help was implemented. Hovering the cursor over standard
	latex commands will present tool tip help. If it is hovers over
	references, the corresponding text passage which contains the label
	is shown as tool tip.</P>
	<LI><P>A preview for selected text can be shown either in the status
	panel or as tool tip.</P>
	<LI><P>The status/log/error panel can also be used in a tabbed
	manner if desired.</P>
	<LI><P>The online spell checker handles escaped chars like &ldquo;a
	or \&rdquo;{a} now correctly. It also refrain from spell checking in
	(some) latex command options like \ref{label} and some more.</P>
	<LI><P>The context menu of the structure view gives some useful
	option like selecting a complete section or indenting a section
	which means changing \section to \subsection and accordingly all
	included headings as well.</P>
	<li><p>A thesaurus was added. It allows search for word parts as well.</p>
	<LI><P>For sure, lots of bugs have been squashed !</P>
</ul>
<h2><a name="SECTIONNEW199">0.2 Version 1.9.3 -> Version 1.9.9</a></h2>
<ul>
    <LI><p>User Tags can use java script to manipulate the current document. The manipulation is done via direct cursor handling. If further functionality is needed, feel free to open a feature request.</p>
    <li><p>some performance issues on mac have been addressed. Still not perfect, but it should feel much faster on mac.</p>
    <li><p>math constructs can be previewed with mouse hover over the expression limit ($, begin{equation},...)</p>
    <li><p>a customizable tool bar is available</p>
    <li><p>the latex expressions in the Math/Latex-Menus can be changed to user preferred versions.</p>
    <li><p>global find over all open documents improved</p>
    <li><p>support of transparent versioning of text documents via svn</p>
    <li><p>structure view and custom command completer are updated as you type</p>
    <li><p>the structure view marks some aspects with colours like being part of the appendix or missing include files</p>
    <li><p>if a master document is defined, references and labels from open (!) subdocuments can be used for completion as well as for interactive label checking</p>
    <li><p>dde commands can be modified to start a corresponding program if it is not running</p>
    <li><p>if a started latex freezes up, you can kill it by pressing escape after 2 seconds</p>
    <li><p>the folding is now  actually useful: mismatched brackets will not disturb it anymore and folded blocks can be edited</p>
    <li><p>lots of bugs removed after user feedback</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="SECTIONNEW199a">0.3 Version 1.9.9 -> Version 1.9.9a</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>some performance issues on mac have been adressed. It should feel faster for long sible lines on mac.</p>
    <li><p>more than one overlay can be shown at the same time e.g. for syntax highlighting and spell checking</p>
	<li><p>command replacement in completed commands was added</p>
	<li><p>a cut buffer was added. If selected text is replaced with a command via completion, the removed text is used as argument for the inserted command (if applicable)</p>
	<li><p>tool tip in completer shows the surrounding of the label to which the selected reference is pointing</p>
	<li><p>profiles containing predefined short cuts, menu redefinition, editor settings can be imported from a file</p>
	<li><p>when waiting with text cursor on an environment name, a mirror cursor is generated which allows the renaming of the environment (\begin and \end simultaneously)</p>
	<li><p>delete word, a command or an environment by typing ALT-del</p>
	<li><p>spell checking is only done in known text commands</p>
	<li><p>some dialogs adapted to cope better with small screen sizes</p>
    <li><p>lots of bugs removed after user feedback</p>
</ul>

<h1><a name="SECTION0">1. Configuring TeXstudio</a></h1>
Before using TeXstudio, you should configure the editor and latex related commands via the "Configure TeXstudio" command in the "Options" menu ("Preferences" under macosx).
<h2><a name="SECTION01">1.1 Configuring the editor</a></h2>
<p>
You can should set the default encoding for new files ("Configure TeXstudio" -> "Editor" -> "Editor Font Encoding") if you don't want utf8 as encoding. Don't forget to set the same encoding in the preamble of your documents. (e.g. \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}, if you use utf-8).<br>
TeXstudio can auto detect utf-8 and latin1 encoded files, but if you use a different encoding in your existing documents you have to specify it in the configuration dialog before opening them. (and then you also have to disable the auto detection)
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Show Line State Change" sets yellow markers left to the text to show which lines have been changed and are still unsaved. That marker turns grreen if they are saved.
<li>"Show modify time" prints the time since the last key stroke in the status panel.
<li>The selection box "Keep indentation" let you select, wether indented lines are followed by lines of the same indentation after pressing Enter or letting TeXstudio do automatic indentation.
</ul>
</p>
<p><IMG src="configure_editor.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION02">1.2 Configuring the latex related commands</a></h2>
<p>TeXstudio can't compile yours documents if the paths to the LaTeX related commands are wrong.<br>
The default settings should work with the recent and standard LaTeX distributions, but you could have to modify them ("Configure TeXstudio" -> "Commands"). To change a command, just click on the button at the end of the corresponding line and select the command in the file browser : TeXstudio will adapt automatically the syntax of the command.<br>
The <strong>%</strong> character represents the name of the file without the extension and the <strong>@</strong> character will be replaced by the current line number. If you need more options (e.g. absolute paths) use ? and  look at the instruction on the bottom of the configuration dialog. <br>
Section <a href="#SECTION37">Forward/Inverse search</a> gives some example commands for common viewers.
</p>
<p><IMG src="doc14.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION030">1.3 Configuring some general issues</a></h2>
This panel allows the setting of some general aspects.
<ul>
<li>The "style" and "color scheme" of TeXstudio can be selected. The modern variant is closer to texmaker 1.9.
<li>The symbol list can either appear "tabbed" (old behaviour, tabbed activated) or can have small symbol tabs besides the symbol lists which leaves more room for the symbols.
<li>Also the log viewer can appear tabbed which allows faster change between error table, log view and previewer ...
<li>The language of the menus can be changed directly to ignore system settings.
</ul>
<p><IMG src="configure_general.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION03">1.3.1 Configuring the spell checker</a></h2>
<p>
TeXstudio checks the spelling while you type. If the typed text is within a LaTeX-command, TeXstudio takes information from the command-completion-list to determine whether the text is natural language which needs to be checked or just command options which are left alone. Only known LaTeX-commands are considered to be checked in its options!
Therefore make sure that all used packages are activated in the option/completion menu, see the corresponding <a href="#SECTION040">section</a> <br>
The spell checker uses the OpenOffice.org dictionaries. Only GPL French and British dictionaries are distributed with TeXstudio.<br>
Users can download others dictionaries here : <A href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries" target="_blank">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries</A><br>
To configure the spell checker : "Configure TeXstudio" -> "Editor" -> "Spelling dictionary" -> click on the button at the end of the line to select the dictionary with the file browser. If you specify a non existing file the edit gets red.<br>
Warning : spell checking with Ctrl+Shift+F7 starts at the cursor position and not at the beginning of the document.<br><br>
If the interactive spell checker is enabled (default), any wrong spelled word is underlined with a red wave. Click on it with the right mouse to open an menu with a list of possible corrections. There you can also move it to the ignore list. If your dictionary is very large (> 5MB), opening the context menu and showing possible suggestions can take some seconds. If you don't need the suggestion, you can press shift while right clicking and don't have to wait.<br><br>
The ignore list is normally saved in the same directory as the dictionary with the extension .ign. If this isn't possible (e.g. missing access) the list is stored in the user configuration directory.
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION04">1.3.2 Configuring the thesaurus</a></h2>
<p>
The thesaurus uses OpenOffice.org 2.x databases. Only GPL French and US-English and German databases are distributed with TeXstudio.<br>
Users can download others databases here : <A href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries" target="_blank">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries</A><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION041">1.3.3 Configuring latex syntax checker</a></h2>
The latex syntax checker takes the list of possible completion commands to determine if a command is correct.
Furthermore the completion list contains partially additional information to determine in which context a command is valid, whether it is valid only in math-mode or only in tabular-mode.<br>
<h2><a name="SECTION040">1.4 Configuring the autocompletion</a></h2>
<p>
TeXstudio has taken up completion word list from kile which extended the number of known commands for completion considerably.
TeXstudio understands the use of \documentclass and \usepackage in order to select valid lists of commands for completion as well as syntax checking.
However TeXstudio allows to select the additional word lists under 
"Configure TeXstudio" -> "Editor" -> "". The names of the word lists corresponds to the package for which they are made. The list latex.cwl contains the standard latex commands. <br>
Concerning auto completion, TeXstudio allows to adapt the behaviour to your liking.
Following options are available:
<ul>
<li>Completion enabled: self explanatory
<li>Case sensitive: let's you complete e.g. \Large from \la ...
<li>in first character: ?
<li>Auto Complete Common Prefix: if only one item is in the list or all items in the completion list share common starting characters, the common characters are directly inserted, like pressing the key Tab.
<li>Complete selected text when non-word character is pressed: when in completion mode, pressing a non-word character like space, leads to accepting the selected word. This may speed up typing.
<li>Enable ToolTip-Help: show tool tips on selected latex commands in the completion list.
<li>Use Placeholders: if the completed commands have options which need to be filled out, "place holder" are put at this positions and they can be jumped to by using Ctrl+Right/Ctrl+Left.
</ul>
If your favorite package is not yet present for completion (and then as well not for syntax check), you can provide a list of your own by placing a file "packagename.cwl" in the config directory. This directory is placed in ~/.config/benibela under linux and usually "c:\Documents and Settings/User/AppData/Roaming/benibela" under windows. Basically the file contains a list of valid commands. A Description of the exact format and an example are given in the <a href="#CWLDESCRIPTION">appendix</a>.
</p>

<p><IMG src="configure_completion.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION05">1.5 Configuring shortcuts</a></h2>
<p>
Shortcuts can be changed by double clicking on "Current Shortcut" or "Additional Shortcut".
A shortcut can be selected from the drop down list or put in as text directly.
If a shortcut should be set to default value or removed completely, the items "&lt;default&gt;" or "&lt;none&gt;" at the top of the list can be selected.
</p>
<p><IMG src="configure_shortcuts.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION06">1.6 Configuring the Latex/Math-Menu</a></h2>
<p>The Math/Latex-Menu can be adapted to user likings.
For this menu items can be renamed and a new Latex-Code can be placed. The apropriate item can be be directly edited by doubleclicking on them.
</p>
<p><IMG src="configure_customizeMenu.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION07">1.7 Configuring the Custom Toolbar</a></h2>
<p>One Custom Toolbar is present in TMX. This toolbar can be filled with actions from the Latex-, Math- and User-Menu.
Since many of those item don't have icons, user icons can be loaded as well. This is achieved by applying "load other icon" from the context menu on a item in the custom toolbar list in the configure dialog.
</p>
<p><IMG src="configure_customToolbar.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION08">1.8 Configuring SVN support</a></h2>
<p>To provide documenten versioning, TeXstudio makes use of SVN (subversion). To make use of it, the SVN commandline tools need to be installed.
Linux and Mac OSX normally provide already svn tools, for Windows, the installation of "SlikSVN" is recommended.
</p>
<p>
The complete path to the command "svn" and "svnadmin" need to be adjusted in the aprioriate field of the svn configure page, see below.
Furthermore the user can choose the degree of automation, which TeXstudio provides.
</p>
<p>
"Automatically check in after save" allows TeXstudio to perform an svn check in after every save of a document, thus providing a very complete history of the creation of a document.
Since text documents are rather small compared to disk spaces, size of the svn database should not be a problem.
In addition newly saved files (save as) are automatically added to svn control,provided that the directory is alredy under svn control.
If that is not the case, TeXstudio searches in "SVN Directory Search Depth" directory above the current diorectory for a svn controlled directory to which the subdirectories and the TeX-Document will be added.
If no appropriate directory is found, a repository is automatically generated in a directory called "./repo" and the document is added.
Thus the user does not need to look up the necessary commands to set up a repository. This functionality is only activated when "Auto checkin in" is enabled !
</p>
<p>
With "User SVN revisions to undo before last save" TeXstudio will perform undo as usually, but if there are no further undoable commands in the internal storage, the document will be changed to the previous version in svn history.
Further undo commands allows to back further to older revisions, whereas a redo goes forward to more recent versions.
This is a more interactive approach than choosing svn revisions directly via a menu command, see <a href="#SECTION33a">section 4.3</a>
</p>
<p><IMG src="configure_svn.png" border="1"></p>
<h1><a name="SECTION1">2. Editing a TeX document</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTION11">2.1 Usual commands</a></h2>
<p>The standard commands (cut, copy, find...) can be launched via the "Edit" menu and the "Edit" tool bar.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc1.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION12">2.2.1 Setting the preamble of a TeX document</a></h2>
<p>To define the preamble of your document, you can use the "Quick start" wizard ("Wizard" menu).</p>
<p><IMG src="doc2.png" border="1"></p>
<p>This dialog allows you to set the main features of your document (class, paper size, encoding...).<br>Note : You can add other options by clicking the "+" buttons. All yours settings are recorded.</p>
<p>You can also type your own preamble model in the editor : with the "Copy/paste" or "Save As" commands, you can use it for a new document.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION12a">2.2.2 Using Templates to start a new document</a></h2>
For new documents, templates can be used by using the command "File/New from template".
A dialogue gives a selection of templates.
<p><IMG src="template.png" border="1"></p>
New templates can be added by using the command "File/Make Template" on a opened document which you like to have has a template.
User added templates can be edited or deleted by using the context menu in the template selection dialogue.
Built-in templates can not be changed.
<h2><a name="SECTION13">2.3 Structure of a document</a></h2>
<p>To define a new part (section,subsection...) in your document with TeXstudio, just use this combo box in the tool bar :</p>
<p><IMG src="doc3.png" border="1"></p>
<p>This will cause a dialog to pop up which allows you to define the style of the part (section,subsection...).<br>Note : the "Structure View" is automatically updated.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc4.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION14">2.4 Browsing your document</a></h2>
<p>The "Structure View" (left panel) lets you quickly reach any part of your document. All you need to do is to click on any item (label, section...) and you will be taken to the beginning of the corresponding area in the editor. The mechanism for jumping to a line does not anymore only consider line numbers but really remembers text lines. Thus adding and removing lines will not lead to jumps to wrong locations.</p>
<p>A grey background shows the present cursor position in the text in the structure view as well. A greenish background denotes sections which are in the appendix.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc5.png" border="1"></p>
<p>The "Structure View" is automatically updated as you type. You can also use the "Refresh Structure" ("Edit" menu) command at any moment.</p>
<p>Apart from labels,sections,includes and beamer blocks, comments starting with %TODO are also scanned for and presented as section of its own in the structure view.
This can be used to create a kind of permanent bookmark in the text or just to note where some changes are still necessary.
</p>
<p>
The structure view also offers a context menu which allows to copy/cut all text which belongs to a section (including subsection) and paste it before or after a section.
Section can be indented/unindented which means that the hierarchy level is changed by one, i.e. \section is changed to \subsection, and all subsections are treated accordingly

</p>
<p>For each file, three bookmarks can be used to speed up navigation : just click on a line number to add or remove a bookmark. When you have already defined three bookmarks, you must remove one of them to add a new bookmark. To jump to the line corresponding to a bookmark in the editor, just click on the buttons in the status bar.</p>

<p><IMG src="doc7.png" border="1"></p>
<p>You can set the main features of your table.<br>Note : this dialog allows you to type directly the code in the cells.<br>The corresponding LaTeX code is automatically inserted in the editor.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION18a">2.8.1 Manipulating tables</a></h2>
TeXstudio provides some commands to ease handling of tables. For this a toolbar "tables" is offered which gives easy access to these commands.
Please be aware that some unexpected results may arise, if the table constructing commands get to complex.
Following commands are offered:
<ul>
<li>add row after the current row</li>
<li>remove row: removes the table row in which the cursor </li>
<li>add column: add a column in the complete table after current cursor position. If the cursor is positioned at start of line,first column, the column is added as new first column.</li>
<li>remove column: remove current column</li>
<li>add/remove \hline: add/remove \hline in all rows following the current row. If already a command \hline is present, no second command is placed.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="SECTION19">2.9 Inserting a "tabbing" environment</a></h2>
<p>To help you to insert a "tabbing" code, you can use the "Tabbing" wizard ("Wizard" menu) :</p>
<p><IMG src="doc8.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION110">2.10 Inserting a picture</a></h2>
<p>To insert a picture in your document, just use the "\includegraphics" command in the "LaTeX" menu. Then, click on the "browser" button in the dialog to select the graphic file.<br>Note : you can insert a "figure" LaTeX environment ("LaTeX - Environments" menu) before inserting the picture.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc9.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION110a">2.10.1 Inserting a picture using a "wizard"</a></h2>
<p>TeXstudio offers a wizard for picture insertion in your document. Apart from selecting a file, you can also have TeXstudio include an appropriate figure-environment with label and caption correctly set.</p>
<p><IMG src="wizard_figure.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION111">2.11 Cross References and notes</a></h2>
<p>This toolbox in the toolbar allows you to insert quickly the label, cite, ref, footnote... code.<br>Note : the labels used in your documents are displayed in the "Structure View".</p>
<p><IMG src="doc10.png" border="1"></p>
<p><b>Additional option:</b>for the \ref command, a dialog box allows you to select directly the label.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION112">2.12 Inserting math formula</a></h2>
<p>You can toggle in the "in-line math" environment with the "f(x)" button in the toolbar (shortcut : Ctrl+Alt+M) or with the "Math" menu. The shortcut for the "display math" environment is : Alt+Shift+M.<br> The "Math" toolbar allows you to insert the most currents mathematical forms (frac, sqrt...) like the \left and \right tags.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc11.png" border="1"></p>
<p>With the "symbols panels" in the structure view, you can insert the code of 400 mathematical symbols.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc12.png" border="1"></p>
<p>You can also define the format of your mathematical text via the "Math" menu.<br>For the "array" environments, a wizard (like the "Tabular" wizard) is available in the "Wizard" menu. With this wizard, you can select the environment : array, matrix, pmatrix.... The cells can be directly completed.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc13.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION113">2.13 Auto Completion</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you press \  followed by a letter, a list of possible LaTex tags is shown where you select the right one. If you write additional letters the list is filtered, so that only the tags starting with the already written text are shown. 
If the list contains words which all start with the same letter combination, you can press Tab to complete all common letters. If only one element is present in the list, Tab selects this one to do the completion, like Enter. This behaviour is similar to tab completion in bash shells.
You can also press Ctrl+Space to open this list whenever you want.<br>
If a tag has different options, a short descriptive text is inserted into your text, telling you the meaning of each option. You can press Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right to select all positions.<br>
Furthermore normal text can be completed by starting to type a word and pressing Ctrl+Space. All apropriate words in the current document are used as possible suggestions.<br>
If a enviroment is to be inserted, typing in the beginning of the environment name and pressing Ctrl+Alt+Space gives suggestions for adequate enviroments which are inserted completely with \begin{env}..\end{env}<br>
And finally user tags can be assigned a abbreviation which can also be used with completion. Just type in the start of the abbreviation and start the completion with Ctrl+Space. The abbreviation should show up in the completion list, especially marked with &ldquo;abbreviation (template)&rdquo;.<br>
If you change a command by completing a new command, only the command name is substituted. The same is true for environments, where the environment is changed in the \begin- and \end-command.
</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION114">2.14 Thesaurus</a></h2>
TeXstudio has integrated a simple thesaurus. OpenOffice 2.x databases are used for this.
By placing the cursor on a word and activating the thesaurus (Ctrl+Shift+F8 or Edit/Thesaurus), it tries to find synonyms for this word. Please be patient if you start the thesaurus at first time since loading the database just occurs then and can take a few moments.
<p><IMG src="thesaurus.png" border="1"></p>
The first line to the left contains the word, for which a synonym is searched for.
The list below gives a list of word classes. The can be chosen to reduce the number of suggestions.
The column to the right contains the list of suggested synonyms.
A selected word from this list apears in the first line to the right as proposition for replacement of the text.
This word can be changed manually. It is also used to do further investigations for words and their synonyms which "start with" or "contain" that word. With "lookup" it can be directly used to look for a synonym for that word.
<h2><a name="SECTION115">2.15 Special Commands</a></h2>
<h3>Delete word/command/environment</h3>
With the shortcut Alt+Del, the word under the cursor is deleted.
If it is a command, the command is deleted including opening and closing braces.
E.g. "\textbf{text}" leave "text".
If it is an environment, the enclosing bengin/end are removed.
<h3>Rename environment</h3>
If you place the cursor on an environment name or the corresponding begin- or end-command, after a moment a mirror-cursor is activated on the environment name which allows synchronous change of the environment name in the begin- and end-command.
So if you want to change a "\begin{tabular}...\end{tabular}" construction to "\begin{tabularx}...\end{tabularx}", place the text cursor on "tabular", wait for a second and then, after the mirror-cursor appears, change "tabular" to "tabularx".
<h3>Cut Buffer</h3>
If you select something and then start to type in a command and complete it, the selection is put in as first argument.
E.g. you have a "text", select it and start typing "\textbf", command which is completed. The resulting text is "\textbf{text}"
<h1><a name="SECTION2">3. Compiling a document</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTION22">3.1 Compiling</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to compile a document is to use the "Quick Build" command ("Quick" button - shortcut : F1). You can define the sequence of commands used by the "Quick Build" command via the "Configure TeXstudio" dialog.<br>You can also launch each command one by one (shortcuts : F2...F12 - see the "Tools" menu).<br> Note : the "Clean" command in the "Tools menu" allows you to erase the files (dvi, toc, aux...) generated by a LaTeX compilation (except the ps and pdf files).<br>
<b>Warning : all yours files must have an extension and you can't compile an "untitled" file or a file with a space in his name</b>.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION23">3.2 The log files</a></h2>
<p>With the "Quick Build" command, the log file is automatically displayed in the "Messages / Log file" pannel. While clicking on a number in the "Line" column, the cursor is placed on the corresponding line in the editor and the error is displayed. <br>
Remark : a summary of the latex errors and warnings is displayed before the full log file.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc15.png" border="1"></p>
<p>The "Next Latex Error"and "Previous LaTeX Error" commands allow to get to the errors detected during compilation.</p>
<p>Lines with errors, warnings, bad boxes will be highlighted with red, yellow or blue background and you can jump between them using Ctrl+Up/Down. (Ctrl+Shift for errors only, Ctrl+Alt for warnings only, Alt+Shift for bad boxes only)<br>
A tool tip will show more details of the mistake if you jump to a line (it is also shown if you move the mouse over the mark left from the line numbers).</p>
<h1><a name="SECTION3">4. Other features</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTION31">4.1 About documents separated in several files</a></h2>
<p>TeXstudio allows you to work onto documents separated in several files.<br>
To include a TeX file into your document, just use the "\include{file}" command in the "LaTeX" menu. The file will appear in the "Structure View". With a click on his name, TeXstudio will open it.</p>
<p>TeXstudio now understands parent/child relations of loaded documents (1 level only !). Therefor, as in "master document mode", only the parent document is compiled if compilation is tarted while working on a child document. Likewise labels and usercommands are known in all corresponding documents.</p>
<p>You can still define your "master document" with the "Options" menu. All the commands of the "Tools" menu will apply only to this document even when working on the "children" documents (you can even close the "master" document).<br>
If a master document is set, labels and usercommands which are defined in any open document, can be used for completion in any open document. Thus you can insert easily a reference to a label which is defined in another subdocument, as long as that document is open in TeXstudio. 
<br>Note : you can leave the "master" mode with the "Options" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION32a">4.2 Syntax Check</a></h2>
The latex syntax checker takes the list of possible completion commands to determine if a command is correct.
The completion list contains partially additional information to determine in which context a command is valid, whether it is valid only in math-mode or only in tabular-mode.<br>
Furthermore the correctness of tabulars is checked in a little  more detail.
The number of columns is analyzed and checked in the subsequent rows. If more or less columns are given in a row, a warning maker is shown.<br>
<h2><a name="SECTION32">4.3 Bibliography</a></h2>
<p>For the "bib" files , the "Bibliography" menu enables you to directly insert the entries corresponding to the standard types of document.<br>Note: the optional fields can be automatically deleted with the "Clean" command of the "Bibliography" menu.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc16.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION33a">4.4 SVN Support</a></h2>
<p>
Apart from the supported svn features already describes in section 1.8, TeXstudio supports two more commands.
</p>
<p>
"File/chekin" performs an explicit save and check in, with a input dialog which asks for an checkin in message which is stored in the svn history.
</p>
<p>
"File/Show old Revisions" pops up a dialog, which shows all alvailable revisions. A selection of an older revision leads to instatanious change of the current document to that older revision.
You can can select and copy old parts to transfer them to the most recent version of your document, by copying the parts and then going back to most recent version. If you start editing that document directly, the dialog is closed and the present text is your new 
most recent version though yet unsaved.
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION33">4.5 Personals tags and tools</a></h2>
<p>TeXstudio allows you to insert your own tags (shortcuts : Shift+F1...Shift+F10). These tags are defined with the "User - User Tags" menu.<br>Note : if the code of the menu is "%environment", TeXstudio will directly insert:<br>
\begin{environment }<br>
<br>
\end{environment }<br>
<br>
If you write %| somewhere the cursor will be placed at that place in the inserted text. (A second %| will select everything between them).<br>
Write %&lt;something%&gt; to mark it as descriptive text which can be selected by Ctrl+Left/Right.
<br>
The option %(<i>filefilter</i>%) will be replaced by a filename which is asked for in a file dialog. The file filter is the standard Qt-Filefilterformat.
For example "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg);;Text files (*.txt);;XML files (*.xml)", see also <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qfiledialog.html#getOpenFileName">Qt-Doc</a>
</p>
<p><IMG src="doc17.png" border="1"></p>
<p>
Instead of using code snippets, you can also make use of javascript.
To do so, put "%SCRIPT" in the first line. The following code will be interpreted as javascript.
The language is based on <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/ecmascript.html">ECMAScript</a>.
To access the document, to objects are introduced:
<ul>
<li>"editor" allows some top level operations like save/load.
<li>"cursor" gives access to cursor operations like moving, inserting and deleting texts.
<li>"fileChooser" gives access to the filechooser dialog, a very simple file selection dialog
</ul>
The following table gives an overview on the possible commands.
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td> <b>command</b> </td>
    <td> <b>description</b> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td> editor.search(searchFor, [options], [scope], [callback]) </td>
	<td> Searchs something in the editor. 
	     <ul>
	     <li>searchFor is the text which is searched. It can be either a string (e.g. "..") or a regexp (e.g. /[.]{2}/). </li>
	     <li>options is a string and a combination of "i", "g", "w" to specify a case-<em>i</em>nsensitive search, a <em>g</em>lobal search (continue after the first match) or a whole-<em>w</em>ord-only search. </li>
	     <li>scope is a cursor constraining the search scope (see editor.document().cursor).</li>
	     <li>callback is a function which is called for every match. A cursor describing the position of the match is passed as first argument.</li>
	  </ul> 
	  All arguments except searchFor are optional, and the order may be changed (which may not be future compatible). The function returns the number of found matches.
	  </td>

  <tr>
  	<td> editor.replace(searchFor, [options], [scope], [replaceWith]) </td>
  	<td> This function searches and replaces something in the editor. It behaves like editor.search apart from the replaceWith argument which can be a simple string or a callback function.

Some examples:
<ul>
<li>Execution of editor text: <pre>
%SCRIPT
eval(editor.text());</pre>
You can use this to easier write and test scripts
</li>
<li>Calculator:<pre>
%SCRIPT
currentLine=editor.text(cursor.lineNumber()); 
from=currentLine.lastIndexOf("%")+1; 
to=currentLine.lastIndexOf("="); 
if (from>=0 && to > from) {
  toEvaluate = currentLine.substring(from, to);
  with (Math) { value = eval(toEvaluate);}
  cursor.eraseLine(); 
  cursor.insertText(currentLine.substring(0, from)+toEvaluate+"="+value); 
  cursor.insertLine();
  cursor.movePosition(1,cursorEnums.Left );
}
</pre>
This will evaluate everything between % and = and write the result after the =. You can use it like a calculator if you write %5+3= in the tex file.

<li>(tikz) Coordinate pair mover:
<pre>
%SCRIPT
var doit = function(){

This will add to all selected coordinate pairs the offset of the first pair which translates all pairs in a given direction. E.g. if you have (1 + 1, 2 - 1.5) (3, 4) it will change it to (2, 0.5) (4, 2.5).

<p>You can also launch your own commands (shortcuts : Alt+Shift+F1...Alt+Shift+F5). These commands are defined with the "User - User Commands" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION34">4.6 Pstricks support</a></h2>
<p>The main pstricks commands can be inserted with the "Pstricks" panel in the "Structure View".</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION35">4.7 Metapost support</a></h2>
<p>The metapost keywords can be inserted with the "Metapost" panel in the "Structure View" and the "mpost" command can be launched via the "Tools" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION36">4.8 The "Convert to Html" command</a></h2>
<p>This command (from the "Tools" menu ) produces a set of html pages from a LaTeX source file with one image for each html page. Each page in the slide presentation corresponds to one of the postscript pages you would obtain running LaTeX.<br>
The command also produces an index page corresponding to the table of contents you would obtain with LaTeX. Each item of the index page includes a link to the corresponding html page.</p>
<p>You can create links in the html pages by using the \ttwplink{}{} command in the tex file.<br>
Synopsis :<br> 
\ttwplink{http://www.mylink.com}{my text} (external link)<br>
\ttwplink{page3.html}{my text} (internal link)<br>
\ttwplink{name_of_a_label}{my text} (internal link)<br>
<b>Warning : </b>You can't use this command with the hyperref package (and some others packages). This command can only be used with the "Convert to html" tool.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION37">4.9 "Forward/Inverse search" with TeXstudio</a></h2>
<p>
<h3>Integrated pdf-viewer</h3>
TeXstudio provides an integarted pdf-viewer which offers forward- and inverse-search. Make sure that synctex is activated in the pdflatex command (option -synctex=1 needs to be added), though TeXstudio will ask you if it can correct the command itself if it is not set correctly.<br>
Forward search is automatically done every time the pdf-viewer is opened. TeXstudio will jump to the position where your cursor is currentyl positioned.
Inverse can be activated by clicking in the pdf with CTRL+left mouse button or by slecting "jump to source" in the context menu, which is activated with a right mouse button click.
Furthermore it is possible to enable "Scrolling follows Cursor" in pdf-viewer/configure. This will keep the pdf-viewer position synchronous to your cursor oposition in the editor.
Likewise "Cursor follows Scrolling"  keeps the editor position synchronous to pdf-viewer position.

<h3>General Set-up for external viewers</h3>
Some (dvi) viewers can jump to (and visually highlight) a position in the DVI file that corresponds to a certain line number in the (La)TeX source file.<br>
To enable this forward search, you can enter the command line of the corresponding viewer either as command line for an user tool in the User menu (User/User Commands/Edit...) or in the viewer command line in the config dialog  ("Options/Configure TeXstudio" -> "Commands").
When the viewer is launched, the <b>@</b>-placeholder will be replaced by the current line number and <b>?c:ame</b> by the complete absolute filename of the current file.<br><br>
On Windows, you can execute DDE commands by inserting a command of the form: <span class="command">dde://service/control/[commands...]</span> or (since TeXstudio 1.9.9) also <span class="command">dde://programpath:service/control/[commands...]</span> to start the program if necessary.
<br><br>
Below you can find a list of commands for some common viewers. Of course, you have to replace <i>(your program path)</i> with the path of the program on your computer, if you want to use a command.<br>

<h2><a name="CWLDESCRIPTION">4.12 Description of the cwl format</a></h2>
<p>
Basically a cwl file is a list of valid commands which contains one command per line.
If no further information is given, the command is considered valid at any position in a latex document.
The following characters have special meanings:
<ul>
  <li># (at start of line):comment</li>
  <li># (later):separator for command classifications</li>
</ul>
Follwing classifications are known to tmx:
<ul>
  <li>*: unusual command which is used for completion only in with the "all" tab</li>
  <li>m:valid only in math environment</li>
  <li>t:valid only in tabular environment (or similar)</li>
  <li>T:valid only in tabbing environment</li>
  <li>n:valid only in text environment (i.e. not math env)</li>
  <li>/env1,env2,...:valid only in environment env1 or env2 etc.</li>
</ul>

Simple example:
# test   <- comment
\typein{msg}#* <- unusual command which is only shown in completion "all"
\sqrt{arg}#m   <- only in math mode valid
\vector(xslope,yslope){length}#*/picture  <- unusual command which is only in the picture environment valid
