To compile and install TeXstudio, write:
qmake texstudio.pro
make
make install


On Unix and MacOSX you can also use:
sudo sh BUILD.sh

(you only need to use sudo if you want to install it system-wide)



Requirements : 
* Qt tool kit (www.trolltech.com) (4.4.3 recommended)
* Poppler for the internal pdf preview 
  (can be disabled with the BUILD.sh script, or by passing NO_POPPLER_PREVIEW=true to qmake)
* Phonon to view videos in the pdf preview 
  (only needed if PHONON=true is passed to qmake, or it is enabled with BUILD.sh)
* Ghostscript for the LaTeX to html conversion command.

If poppler/phonon are in non standard directories, you may need to pass the INCLUDEPATH=<your path> LIBS=<your path> options to qmake/BUILD.sh
